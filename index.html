        <h2 id="1">Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Shahin Najafi was born in 1980 in Bandar-e Anzali, Iran. When he was six years old, his father died, and later<br>
                his brother became a drug addict and also died. He began writing poetry as a teenager and began learning the<br>
                guitar in the classical and flamenco styles at the age of 18. He then became an underground artist in Iran,<br>
                performing in both rock and Spanish music styles, working with various bands.<br>
                He studied sociology at the University of Gilan and openly expressed his opinions about the university, leading<br>
                to his getting expelled.

            <h3 id="2.1">Immigration to Germany</h3>
                <p>
                    Najafi was head of an underground music band in Iran before his immigration to Germany, but he was
                    banned for his offenses towards the Islamic faith in Iran by the Iranian government after his second
                    music show.[5] He was also the head of the Inan music band in Germany. Then he joined the Tapesh
                    2012 music band.[6] Tapesh 2012 were welcomed by Persian broadcasters and the international media by
                    political and social songs and poems of Najafi.[7]

                    An article published in No. 19194 of the conservative newspaper Kayhan on 29 September 2008
                    criticized Tapesh 2012's activities. Kayhan published the article titled Establishing democracy with
                    drum & circle. A part of it goes as follows:<br>
                <cite>
                    Recently, opponents of the Islamic Republic of Iran continue their goals in universities and
                    in the form of music groups to make known the autocracies of the Iranian government. Recently
                    some blogs of opposition students have published a statement about "Tapesh 2012" which gives
                    news Establishing One Million Signatures by "Tapesh 2012". This group is composed of some
                    iranian and german that are not affiliated with any party or group. The purpose of this group is
                    attempting to collect signatures and present it on the anniversary of Human rights (10 December)
                    to Parliament of Europe in Brussels. They have attracted world media attention to inappropriate
                    conditions in Iran and dissatisfaction of Iranian people. The Parliament of Europe announced the
                    official support for the group plans. They encourage people to consider how the regime
                    suppresses human rights.

            <h3 id="2.2">Release of first studio album</h3>
                <p>
                    On 1 May 2008, Najafi released his first studio album, Ma mard nistim (We Are Not Men), with partnership
                    and composition of the Tapesh 2012 music band. This album was his official and professional beginning in
                    Persian hip hop music. The album attracted the audience and listener more than any album before it was
                    released in Persian hip hop style.

            <p>
                In addition to individual work in his concerts and campaign songs, Najafi had many performances on various
